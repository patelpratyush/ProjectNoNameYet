                  <p>FinPilot stores the financial information you enter: accounts, transactions, budgets, debts, goals, bills, and preferences. In this demo, all of it lives in your browser’s local storage and never reaches a server.</p>
                  <p>In the production service, we collect your name, email, and the data you add to the app. Optional bank connections are handled by Plaid — FinPilot receives read-only transaction and balance data, never your bank credentials.</p>
                </Section>
                <Section title="2. What we never do">
                  <p>We never sell, rent, or trade your personal financial data. We never show third-party advertising inside the product. We never use your transaction data to train models without explicit consent.</p>
                </Section>
                <Section title="3. How data is protected">
                  <p>Production data is encrypted in transit (TLS) and at rest. Access follows least-privilege principles. See the Security page for details.</p>

                <Section title="4. Your controls">
                  <p>You can export all of your data (CSV or JSON) and delete your account at any time from Settings → Data. Deletion removes your data from our systems within 30 days, except where law requires retention.</p>

                  <p>FinPilot provides personal-finance tracking, budgeting, loan calculation, and planning tools. FinPilot is not a bank, lender, broker, or financial advisor, and does not provide investment, tax, or legal advice.</p>

                  <p>You are responsible for the accuracy of the data you enter and for decisions you make based on the calculations provided. Calculations are estimates — verify figures with your lender or institution before acting.</p>

                <Section title="3. Subscriptions">
                  <p>Paid plans renew automatically until cancelled. You can cancel at any time; access continues until the end of the current billing period. Annual plans are refundable within 30 days of purchase.</p>

                  <p>Do not misuse the service, attempt to access other users’ data, or use FinPilot for unlawful purposes.</p>
